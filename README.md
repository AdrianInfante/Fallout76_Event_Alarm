# Fallout 76 Event Alert Script

This Python script helps players detect in-game events in Fallout 76 by watching for a specific event image on the screen. When the specified image appears, the script will play an alert sound, letting you know that an event is availableâ€”even if you're away from the keyboard.

## Features

- **Automatic Event Detection:** The script continually scans the screen for the specified event image.
- **Sound Alert:** Plays an alert sound when the event image appears, notifying you instantly.
- **Script Restart:** Automatically restarts the scan after detecting an event, so you'll be alerted for each occurrence.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system (3.7 or later recommended).
- **Python Libraries**: This script uses the `pyautogui`, `time`, `winsound`, `os`, and `sys` libraries.

### Install dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** The `winsound` library is Windows-only. For non-Windows systems, use a cross-platform alternative like `playsound`.

## Setup

1. **Add the Target Image**: Capture an image of the Fallout 76 event notification (`event.png`) and save it in the script's directory.
2. **Add an Alert Sound**: Add a `.wav` file for the alert sound (`alert.wav`) and save it in the script's directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   ```cmd
   python fallout76_event_alert.py
   ```
2. **Minimize Fallout 76** or leave it running in windowed mode. The script will scan for the event image and alert you with a sound when it appears on screen.

3. **Adjusting Confidence Level**:
   If the script fails to detect the event reliably, adjust the `confidence` parameter in the `find_image_on_screen` function.

## Script Details

- **`find_image_on_screen(image_path)`**: Scans the screen for the specified image with a customizable confidence level.
- **`main()`**: Continuously monitors for the image and triggers a sound alert when detected. Restarts after a brief delay to re-enable detection for future events.

## Disclaimer

This script is intended for personal use only and may not be compatible with other applications.
